# Contributing to Inrun

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Inrun.

Inrun is the intent runner for Kubernetes. A caller sends an intent through the gateway; Inrun turns it into a custom resource, reconciles it, and returns a view.

## Code style

- `gofmt` is enforced by CI.
- Exported functions must have a doc comment.
- Wrap errors with context: `fmt.Errorf("creating deployment: %w", err)`.
- No comments that describe *what* the code does — only *why* when the reason is non-obvious.
