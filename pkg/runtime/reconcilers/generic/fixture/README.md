# pkg/runtime/reconciler/fixture

Living integration fixture for the reconciler's resource types.

## Why this exists

The runner functions in `pkg/runner/` apply Kubernetes resources from katalog
templates. There is no meaningful way to unit-test them: the logic that matters
— template rendering, server-side apply, status propagation, condition evaluation
— only works against a real API server. Mocking it tests the mock, not Orkestra.

This fixture is the right vehicle. It declares a `ReconcilerSuite` CRD (namespaced,
in `default`) and a `ReconcilerProbe` CRD (cluster-scoped). A single `ReconcilerSuite`
CR is the test entry point: its operator creates a `ReconcilerProbe` via `custom:`, and
the probe's operator then triggers every supported resource block in one reconcile cycle.

The scope split is intentional: Kubernetes GC cannot cascade owner references from a
namespaced owner to a cluster-scoped dependent, so deleting the suite exercises the
explicit `runners.DeleteOwnedClusterScopedResources` path. The probe is cluster-scoped
so it can own resources in `probe-ns` without cross-namespace owner reference issues.

Failures surface as a missing resource, a wrong status field, or an operator crash, all
observable without reading code.

## Running

Run simulate first — it exercises the real reconciler in-memory and is fast:

```bash
ork simulate -f pkg/runtime/reconciler/fixture/simulate.yaml
```

For full cluster verification:

```bash
ork e2e -f pkg/runtime/reconciler/fixture/e2e.yaml --workers 3
```

`ork e2e` creates the kind cluster, installs Orkestra, applies the CRD and CR,
runs all assertions, and tears down the cluster.

To reuse an existing cluster during iteration:

```bash
ork e2e -f pkg/runtime/reconciler/fixture/e2e.yaml --use-current
```

## Adding a new resource type

1. Add a block to the appropriate fixture motif in
   [pkg/runtime/reconciler/fixture/motifs/](./motifs/). Name resources
   `{{ .metadata.name }}-<type>` to avoid collisions.
2. Add a row to the table above.
3. Add a `create` op to [simulate.yaml](./simulate.yaml) for the new resource type.
4. Add a `resources:` assertion to the `All resources created` checkpoint in
   [e2e/01-resources.yaml](./e2e/01-resources.yaml).
5. Run `ork e2e -f pkg/runtime/reconciler/fixture/simulate.yaml` locally before opening the PR.
