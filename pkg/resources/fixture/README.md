# pkg/resources/fixture

Living integration fixture for every `pkg/resources/*` package.

## Why this exists

The `Resolve()` + `Update()`/`Create()` functions in `pkg/resources/` only do something meaningful against a real API server. Unit tests can verify field mapping, but drift detection, idempotency, and k8s default-injection behavior can only be observed live. Mocking the API server tests the mock, not the resource package.

This fixture uses a typed Go hook to call every resource package in a single reconcile cycle. Failures surface as a missing resource, a wrong field, or an operator crash — without reading code.

## What this is

This directory is a **standalone Go module** (`go.mod`) — a minimal typed Inrun operator that imports `github.com/inrundev/inrun-resource-probe` for its CRD types and hook implementation. The hook exercises all 23 resource packages in one reconcile loop.

The standard `inrun` CLI does not know about `ResourceProbe`. You must build a custom binary first.

## Running

### Step 1 — Generate the registry and build the custom binary

```bash
cd pkg/resources/fixture
make registry
make build
```

`make registry` runs `inrun generate registry --file catalog.yaml` to produce the type registry and entrypoint that includes `ResourceProbe`. `make build` compiles a custom `inrun` binary with it. The standard `inrun` cannot run this fixture without this step.

### Step 2 — Verify in-memory

```bash
inrun simulate -f pkg/resources/fixture/simulate.yaml
```

Fast — no cluster needed. Exercises the reconciler logic against a fake API server.

### Step 3 — Full cluster verification

`e2e.yaml` references `values.yaml` which sets the runtime image to `ghcr.io/inrundev/inrun/pkg/resources/fixture:latest`. To use a locally built image instead:

```bash
make docker push IMAGE_REPO=yourregistry/resource-probe IMAGE_TAG=latest
```

Then run e2e:

```bash
inrun e2e -f pkg/resources/fixture/e2e.yaml --workers 3 \
  --set runtime.image.repository=yourregistry/resource-probe \
  --set runtime.image.tag=latest
```

Or with the default published image (no `--set` needed):

```bash
inrun e2e -f pkg/resources/fixture/e2e.yaml --workers 3
```

Creates a kind cluster, installs Inrun with the resource-probe runtime, applies the CR, asserts all resources, and tears down.

To reuse an existing cluster during iteration:

```bash
inrun e2e -f pkg/resources/fixture/e2e.yaml --use-current
```

## Adding a new resource type

1. Add the `Resolve()` + `Update()`/`Create()` call to `hooks/resource_hooks.go`.
2. Add a row to the coverage table above.
3. Add a `create` op to `simulate.yaml` for the new resource type.
4. Add a `resources:` assertion to `e2e/01-resources.yaml`.
5. Run `inrun simulate` locally before opening the PR.
