// The runtime holds every CRD instance in its informer cache — queries here
// are fast in-memory lookups on the runtime side, not live List() calls
// against the API server. That's deliberate: reconcile time is the
// authoritative enforcement point. Here a momentarily stale cache is
// acceptable; worst case, a duplicate slips past admission and is caught
// on the next reconcile, which is the same guarantee every catalog had
// before this existed.
